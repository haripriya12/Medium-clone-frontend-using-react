                        didn't get it.The reception was overwhelmingly positive. A post-launch,in-
                        product survey asked customers how much they liked the new look, and on
                        average they gave it 7.6 out of 10.( if that seems low ,recall that "nobody
                        notices was an accountable outcome")

                    </p>
                    <p>&#8226; Products like Heap must show far more data at a far greater density than 
                        the average consumer app
                    </p>
                    <p>&#8226; Many products, especially in the consumer space</p>
                    <p>&#8226; We knew we wanted something modern, but we didnâ€™t just want to look like
                        everything else; we were hoping to be at least a little distinct.
                    </p>
                    <p>&#8226; Heap is an app, not a website; a desktop thing, not a mobile thing.</p>
